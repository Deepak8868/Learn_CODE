# Learn_CODE with your peers!
This is a repository which contains all the topics that I @rosekamallove studied while learning coding and am currently learning Data Structures and Algorithms, and all the code I wrote are in this repo and I am thninkig of making this repo more like a Learning resourse. 
So why not contribute to it ?

### What are the features?

-> All of the code files of the Apna College Playlist.

-> Guiding articles and RoadMaps
 
-> Question Bank: The problem statement and template and the GFG link already written you just have to write the code.

-> You can make a branch and start solving questions and make your own solution bank in that way we will multiple people solving the same problem with different approach, win win.

-> A great resource for our juniors or who are at a lower skill level.

-> Books for DSA etc...

-> Getting in a habbit of Open-Source Contribution

## Setting up C++ Coding Environment on Windows:
 ### It is a bit complicated for windows I will highly recommend you watch a video rather than an article

## Setting up C++ Coding Environment on Windows:

### It is very easy on linux... just copy paste in the following commands in the terminal.

#### `sudo apt update`
#### `sudo apt install build-essential`

### And that's it.


## Compiling C++ code on the terminal :
 ( I would suggest you going through one of the following tutorial for learning the command line before compiling c++ using the terminal)

Old:

### Now for compiling the C++ code follow along:

Step 1 -> Check if g++ is installed on your computer or not by typing ``` g++ --version ``` on your terminal window.

Step 2 -> Go to the folder containing the c++ files ``` cd Learn_Code```

Step 3 -> Compile using ``` g++ file.cpp ``` this will make a executabel file named ```a.out``` which can be executed by ``` ./a.out ```

Alternatively:

Step 4 -> Compile using ``` g++ file.cpp -o file ``` this will make an executable file named ``` file ``` which can be executed by ``` ./file ```.

Note: You can choose the name of the output executable file it does not have to be same as the C++ file.

### So what is Open-Source?

Open source is a term that originally referred to open source software (OSS). Open source software is code that is designed to be publicly accessible—anyone can see, modify, and distribute the code as they see fit.

Open source software is developed in a decentralized and collaborative way, relying on peer review and community production. Open source software is often cheaper, more flexible, and has more longevity than its proprietary peers because it is developed by communities rather than a single author or company.

Open source has become a movement and a way of working that reaches beyond software production. The open source movement uses the values and decentralized production model of open source software to find new ways to solve problems in their communities and industries.

### Now what the hell is Git&&Github?
What’s a version control system?
A version control system, or VCS, tracks the history of changes as people and teams collaborate on projects together. As the project evolves, teams can run tests, fix bugs, and contribute new code with the confidence that any version can be recovered at any time. Developers can review project history to find out:

-- Which changes were made?

-- Who made the changes?

-- When were the changes made?

-- Why were changes needed?

#### I Wil Highly recommend you go through the following artile at least once.

## Setting up Git and Github on Linux:

(The following commands are for Ubuntu and other Debian based distros like Pop-os etc, you can google things for your specific distro. ) 

### Installing Git:

#### `sudo apt-get install git`

### Setting up Git:

#### `git config --global user.name "username"`
#### `git config --global user.email "useremail@example.com"`
